					Buildings are our homes and our workplaces, directly affecting both our well-being, and through the energy they consume, the natural global environment. Fundamentally, buildings consume energy to provide their occupant with services: thermal and visual comfort, access to water, power for electronic devices, spaces for productive office work, & cetera…

								<p>
In order to design buildings that enhance occupant well-being, improve service delivery, and reduce energy consumption, it is vital to develop ways to understand how occupants interact with their built environments. Occupant-building dynamics are the complex interactions between buildings and humans or groups of humans within buildings, encompassing occupant behavior and activities (i.e., the specific actions that occupants take in buildings), occupancy/activity states (i.e., abstracted and categorized information about occupant behavior), and the impact of occupant behavior on building operation. These dynamics are challenging to understand due to the increasing complexity of our building systems and the socio-technical dynamics of occupant behavior. Even gaining a clear picture of the spatial and temporal activity patterns of occupants within a building is a non-trivial task [1]. 								</p>

								<h4>We have unprecedented access to unstructured information from building sensors, but we have not been able to realize its full potential.</h4>

								<p class="excerpt">
								</p>

								<p>
The new and increasing presence of sensors and intelligently controlled systems in buildings has led to massive expansions in the amount of high-fidelity data describing how the characteristics of buildings change over time. This data has been shown to be useful both to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and to improve models that describe space-utilization in buildings. Within buildings, researchers have worked toward achieving as closely as possible a condition in which building systems—such as lighting, heating, and cooling—are provided only as much as they are needed, and only where and when they are needed. </p>

								<p>
While new types of sensors have facilitated more data-driven approaches to systems control, their application to understanding occupant dynamics has been limited. Sensors designed to directly detect occupancy often mischaracterize the spaces they are sensing due to the complexity associated with various building spaces [2]. New statistical and data mining techniques have been proposed to infer occupancy patterns from emerging high-fidelity data streams such as light levels [3], energy use [4], sound [5], and video [6]. However, these methodologies typically require a significant amount of ground truth training data that is cumbersome and often cost prohibitive to collect, thereby limiting their applicability and feasibility at scales beyond small pilot studies. Conversely, knowledge-driven approaches to understanding occupant dynamics in buildings (e.g., surveys, on-site engineering audits) can yield insights on occupant dynamics [7,8] but suffer from common reliability and scalability issues associated with indirect collection instruments [9].

								<h4>Occupancy data has the potential to revolutionize space use planning.</h4>

								<div class="deskstop-12 tablet-12 columns">

								<p class="excerpt">
								</p>

								<p>
While whole-building data and occupancy data have typically been studied in the context of energy efficient management of existing buildings, they also have the potential to be tremendously useful in providing knowledge to designers in the early stages of building design about likely occupant activities in the spaces they create. This previous research has utilized model-based optimization in the design of buildings [10], and more specifically, in the planning of space layouts in buildings [11–13]. Recent work has conceptualized models that utilize computing in the assessment of the functional properties of designed spaces [14]. Specifically, analyzing designs for their ability to perform their function—for example, the ability for a proposed office space to promote a productive work environment—depends on knowledge from empirically based methods (e.g., surveys) [15].

								</p>
 								<p>
In their planning process, architects have long considered how occupants will use the spaces they design. Formalized integration of human-centered knowledge into the building design process has previously been focused on perceptions of space [16] and heuristics for improved layouts [17], among others. More recent work has underscored the notion that it is difficult to quantify and optimize the function of spaces due to a lack of information about how occupants utilize spaces designed for them. Dzeng et al. [12] found that function space assignment optimizations that are based on user activities can increase the prescribed function objectives significantly. However, these methods typically use occupant activity simulation models that are built on occupant activity data obtained through onerous methods such as defining heuristics from previous spaces and predetermined schedules [12] or from specialized occupant movement sensors [18]. With the potential to accurately and granularly detect occupant activities in existing buildings from more ubiquitous sensors, new design knowledge integration approaches will have greater opportunity to incorporate empirically grounded occupant activity patterns into new design heuristics.

								<p>
As engineers and designers continue developing tools to aid in the design of buildings that more appropriately meet the needs of their occupants, analysis of the utilization of spaces has become increasingly important. Space-use analysis helps designers determine how appropriately the spaces within a building are serving their occupants. Spaces that are properly utilized fulfill their design intentions by having a certain level of occupancy at predetermined times and by not inhibiting occupants from performing predetermined activities. Spaces that are not properly utilized can either be underutilized (in which case they are inefficient in their use of space), or they can be too crowded (in which case they inhibit occupants from performing the activities they were meant to be able to perform), with proper utilization rates depending on the nature of the space being analyzed [19,20]. Recently, researchers have proposed frameworks that can be helpful for architects working on space-utilization in the programming phase of their design process, but that depends on a detailed understanding of how occupants use the spaces designed for them [20]. There remains significant opportunity to analyze and visually represent the activities of occupants in existing spaces for greater understanding of occupant dynamics in planned spaces [21,22].
								</p>
								<p>
Further improvement of the accuracy of models that help designers understand how occupants will use the spaces they plan depends on a solid understanding of how occupants utilize spaces in existing buildings. Only by monitoring and understanding the dynamics of occupant dynamics in existing buildings can we hope to imagine how occupants will behave in the new buildings we design [23].

The preliminary method I have developed utilizes data from plug load sensors installed at individual occupants’ workstations. I tested my method for 41 occupants in an open-office building in San Francisco, CA, USA using Enmetric plug load sensors [24]. The sensors continuously collected and reported total energy use over 15-minute periods at the individual desk level. My analysis resulted in a total of three possible states for each 15-minute period for each day for each occupant, which I delineate as low energy (green), medium energy (yellow), and high energy (red) states. Using variational Bayesian inference methods, I am able to infer the natural number of activity states present in the data. The result of this analysis is a mapping from raw energy use values to states of occupant activities in the building. The figure below illustrates this mapping for each occupant over the floor plan of the building. As the left-hand side shows, it can be difficult to understand the meaning of the raw energy use values, since a value of, for example, 5Wh over the 15-minute period can mean very different things for two different occupants. However, as the right-hand side shows, the mapping into activity states abstracts information about these energy use values, providing deeper insights into the behavior of occupants across the floorplan of the building.						</p>

								 The figure to the left shows the progression of occupancy states for each of the 41 occupants over one afternoon/evening in the study period, from the 15-minute period ending at 5:00pm to the 15-minute period ending at 7:15pm (10 time-steps in total). Monitoring this progression provides insight into how the space utilization in this office setting changes over time. This information provides value for building managers who seek to ensure that spaces are being utilized efficiently. Furthermore, as building designers and engineers embrace the notion of performance based design, they are beginning to adapt the programming phase of the design process to include more nuanced understandings of space utilization. Monitoring and visualizing activity states in buildings can help in the development of space use frameworks that more closely align with the true states of occupant behavior in buildings.

						<h4>Programming, planning, and design can benefit from tools that can infer occupant behavior.</h4>
					</div>
					<p>
						A deeper understanding of the complexity of occupant dynamics translates to new knowledge that can help building designers, engineers, and managers determine how occupants respond to the spaces they occupy. Buildings will inevitably continue to play a crucial role in each of our lives as occupants and in the world’s sustainable energy future. New methods that combine extant knowledge of occupant dynamics and building systems with emerging data-driven methods could provide us with the necessary insights to design, operate, and manage the next generation of high-performance buildings.

The plan and diagram below represents one example of a public-private interface for a fictional company in the knowledge industry. This interface is built on the notion that interaction between the knowledge workers and the public could spur innovation in the company, or create situations of “engineered serendipity.” As designs like this one become more common in future workplaces, being able to determine the true behavior of occupants will lead toward an ability to create more accurate models of space use.

						The rendering below represents one idea for a space that connects occupants to the outdoors, inspires interaction, and adds to quality of life. If we could incorporate into designs such as this an ability to represent more accurate space use models, we can ensure the space is working as intended. Or, if the manager of the space sees an oppotunity for change, he or she could make use of its flexibility to adapt to the behavior of the occupants.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unprecendented access to building data streams has the potential to revolutionize design, and modeling occupant behavior through new data streams can be an important piece of this change. The Digital X Workshop will provide me with an opporunity to network with accomplished scholars and architects. While continuing to develop my ideas, I will receive invaluable feedback and understand how my engineering-oriented ideas can be part of a conversation that bridges the gap between architecture and engineering.
