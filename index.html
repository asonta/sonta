        <p>You can (and should!) feel free to play around with what I've given you here. buuuuuuut, after thinking about it you may have some better luck trying out something like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, which gives you something to work off of. You'll be able to get your website started by following the instructions off of their documentation.</p>

        <p>Don't be afraid to ask me any questions you may have!</p>
